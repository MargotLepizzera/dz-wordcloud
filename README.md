# dz-wordcloud

Hi there! </br></br>
In this GitHub repository, you'll find a .csv file with about 150 rows of Beatles lyrics data and a file containing pictures you can use as masks for your future wordclouds :cloud:

You'll also find pieces of the script to create the wordcloud on Gist, so feel free to check them out!

If you're interested in reading the Deezer wordcloud blogpost as a whole, it's right here (mettre lien)

Cheers!
