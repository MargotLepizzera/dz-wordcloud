# dz-wordcloud

Hi there! </br></br>
In this GitHub repository, you'll find a file containing pictures you can use as masks for your future wordclouds :cloud:

You'll also find pieces of the script to create the wordcloud on Gist, so feel free to check them out!

If you're interested in reading the Deezer wordcloud blogpost as a whole, it's right [here](https://deezer.io/a-new-way-to-look-at-an-artist-from-lyrics-to-wordclouds-christmas-special-56a854cb4e77#.m4k93ggvk)
