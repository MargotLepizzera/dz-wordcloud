dakota  there lived a young boy named rocky raccoon,  and one day his woman ran off with another guy,  hit young rocky in the eye.  rocky didn't like that  he said, i'm gonna get that boy.  so one day he walked into town  booked himself a room in the local saloon.    rocky raccoon checked into his room,  only to find gideon's bible.  rocky had come, equipped with a gun,  to shoot off the legs of his rival.  his rival it seems, had broken his dreams,  by stealing the girl of his fancy.  her name was magill, and she called herself lil,  but everyone knew her as nancy.  now she and her man, who called himself dan,  were in the next room at the hoe down.  rocky burst in, and grinning a grin,  he said, danny boy, this is a showdown.  but daniel was hot, he drew first and shot,  and rocky collapsed in the corner.    now the doctor came in, stinking of gin,  and proceeded to lie on the table.  he said, rocky, you met your match.  and rocky said, doc, it's only a scratch.  and i'll be better, i'll be better, doc, as soon as i am able.    now rocky raccoon, he fell back in his room,  only to find gideon's bible.  gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt,  to help with good rocky's revival. oh ain't she sweet,   well see her walking down that street.   yes i ask you very confidentially:   ain't she sweet?     oh ain't she nice,   well look her over once or twice.   yes i

the people that come and go  stop and say hello.    on the corner is a banker with a motorcar,  and little children laugh at him behind his back.  and the banker never wears a mac  in the pouring rain, very strange.    penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  there beneath the blue suburban skies  i sit, and meanwhile back  in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,  and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.  he likes to keep his fire engine clean,  it's a clean machine.    penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  a four of fish and finger pies  in summer. meanwhile back  behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout  the pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.  and though she feels as if she's in a play,  she is anyway.    in penny lane the barber shaves another customer,  we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,  and then the fireman rushes in  from the pouring rain - very strange.    penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  there beneath the blue suburban skies  i sit, and meanwhile back.  penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  there beneath the blue suburban skies  penny lane! picture yourself in a boat on a river with
