"""I'm the Sheik of Araby,   Your love belongs to me.  At night when you're asleep   Into your tent I'll creep.  The stars that shine above,  Will light our way to love.  You'll rule this land with me;"
(Help) I need somebody  (Help) not just anybody  (Help) you know I need someone  (Help)    (When) when I was younger (when I was young) so much younger than today  (I never needed) I never needed anybody's help in any way  (Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)  Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors    Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  And I do appreciate you being 'round  Help me get my feet back on the ground  Won't you please, please help me?    (Now) and now my life has changed (my life has changed) in oh-so-many ways (my independence)  My independence seems to vanish in the haze  (But) but every now and then (now and then) I feel so insecure (I know that I)  I know that I just need you like I never done before    Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  And I do appreciate you being 'round  Help me get my feet back on the ground  Won't you please, please help me?    When I was younger, so much younger than today  I never needed anybody's help in any way  (Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)  Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors    Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  And I do appreciate you being 'round  Help me get my feet back on the ground  Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, ooh?
1 2 2 toobidoo.   The leaves of brown   Came tumbling down,   Remember in September in the rain.   The sun went out   Just like a light,   Remember in September in the rain.     To every word   Of love I heard you whisper   The raindrops seems   To play a sweet refrain.   Thought it's spring,   To me it's still September,   Oh that September in the rain.     To every word   Of love I heard you whisper   The raindrops seems   To play a sweet refrain.   Thought it's spring,   To me it's still September,   Oh that September in the rain.   I said I said it's September in the rain.   Ah September in the rain.
A little help from my friends What would you think if I sang out of tune, Would you stand up and walk out on me. Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song, And I'll try not to sing out of key.  I get by with a little help from my friends, I get high with a little help from my friends, Going to try with a little help from my friends.  What do I do when my love is away. (Does it worry you to be alone) How do I feel by the end of the day (Are you sad because you're on your own)  No I get by with a little help from my friends, Do you need anybody, I need somebody to love. Could it be anybody I want somebody to love.  Would you believe in a love at first sight, Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time. What do you see when you turn out the light, I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.  Oh I get by with a little help from my friends, Do you need anybody, I just need somebody to love, Could it be anybody, I want somebody to love.  I get by with a little help from my friends, Yes I get by with a little help from my friends, With a little help from my friends.
Ah look at all the lonely people Ah look at all the lonely people  Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice In the church where a wedding has been Lives in a dream Waits at the window, wearing the face That she keeps in a jar by the door Who is it for  All the lonely people Where do they all come from? All the lonely people Where do they all belong?  Father McKenzie, writing the words Of a sermon that no one will hear No one comes near Look at him working, darning his socks In the night when there's nobody there What does he care  All the lonely people Where do they all come from? All the lonely people Where do they all belong?  Ah look at all the lonely people Ah look at all the lonely people  Eleanor Rigby, died in the church And was buried along with her name Nobody came Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt From his hands as he walks from the grave No one was saved  All the lonely people Where do they all come from? All the lonely people Where do they all belong?
All my little plans and schemes, Lost like some forgotten dreams, Seems that all I really was doing Was waiting for you.  Just like little girls and boys, Playing with their little toys. Seems like all they really were doing Was waiting for love.  Don't need to be alone, No need to be alone. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real.  From this moment on I know Exactly where my life will go. Seems that all I really was doing Was waiting for love.  Don't need to be afraid, No need to be afraid. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real.  Thought I'd been in love before, But in my heart, I wanted more. Seems like all I really was doing Was waiting for you.  Don't need to be alone, Don't need to be alone. It's real love, it's real. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. It's real love, it's real.
All through' the day   I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.  All through' the night   I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.

All I can hear   I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.  Even those tears   I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.

As I was slowly passing   An orphan's home one day,   I stopped for just a little while   To watch the children play.   Alone a boy was standing   And when I asked him why,   He turned with eyes that could not see   And he began to cry.     I'm nobody's child,   I'm nobody's child.   Just like the flowers   I'm growing wild.   I got no mummy's kisses   I got no daddy's smile.   Nobody wants me,   I'm nobody's child.     No mummy's arms to hold me   Or sue me when I cry,   'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome   I wish that I could die.   I'll walk the streets of heaven   Where all blinds can see.     And just like for the other kids   It will be a home for me.     I'm nobody's child,   I'm nobody's child.   Just like the flowers   I'm growing wild.   I got no mummy's kisses   I got no daddy's smile.   Nobody wants me,   I'm nobody's child.

Born a poor young country boy  Mother Nature's son  All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone.    Sit beside a mountain stream  See her waters rise  Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.    Find me in my field of grass  Mother Nature's son  Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.    Mother Nature's son.

Have you seen the little piggies  Rolling in the dirt?  And for all the little piggies  Life is getting worse,  Always having dirt to play around in    Have you seen the bigger piggies  In their starched white shirts?  You will find the bigger piggies  Stirring up the dirt,  Always have clean shirts to play around in    In their styes with all their backing  They don't care what goes on around  In their eyes there's something lacking  What they need's a damn good whacking    Everywhere there's lots of piggies  Living piggy lives  You can see them out for dinner  With their piggy wives  Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

"I listen for your footsteps  Coming up the drive.  Listen for your footsteps  But they don't arrive.  Waiting for your knock, dear  On my old front door.  I don't hear it,  Does it mean you don't love me anymore?    I hear the clock a'ticking,  On the mantel shelf.  See the hands a'moving,  But I'm by myself.  I wonder where you are tonight,  And why I'm by myself.  I don't see you,  Does it mean you don't love me anymore?    Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.  'Cause you know darling, I love only you.  You'll never know it hurt me so,  I hate to see you go.  Don't pass me by, don't make me cry.    I'm sorry that I doubted you,  I was so unfair.  You were in a car crash,  And you lost your hair.  You said that you would be late  About an hour or two.  I said, ""That's alright, I'm waiting here,  Just waiting to hear from you"".    Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.  'Cause you know darling, I love only you.  You'll never know it hurt me so,  I hate to see you go.  Don't pass me by, don't make me cry.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently weeps.  I don't know why nobody told you How to unfold your love I don't know how someone controlled you They bought and sold you.  I look at the world and I notice it's turning While my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps.  I don't know how you were diverted You were perverted too I don't know how you were inverted No one alerted you.  I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps Look at you all Still my guitar gently weeps.
"I once had a girl   Or should I say she once had me   She showed me her room   Isn't it good Norwegian wood?     She asked me to stay   And she told me to sit anywhere   So I looked around   And I noticed there wasn't a chair     I sat on a rug biding my time   Drinking her wine   We talked until two and then she said   ""It's time for bed""     She told me she worked   In the morning and started to laugh   I told her I didn't   And crawled off to sleep in the bath     And when I awoke I was alone   This bird had flown   So I lit a fire   Isn't it good Norwegian wood?"

Found my coat and grabbed my hat  Made the bus in seconds flat  Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,  Somebody spoke and I went into a dream    I read the news today oh boy  Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire  And though the holes were rather small  They had to count them all  Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

If you're listening to this song You may think the chords are going wrong But they're not We just wrote them like that  If you're listening late at night You may think the band are not quite right But they are The just play it like that  And it doesn't really matter what chords I play What words I say Or time of day it is As it's only a Northern song  It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear What words I pair Or if my hair is brown 'Cause it's only a Northern song  If you think the harmony Is a little dull and out of key You're correct 'Cause there's nobody there  And it's only there's no one there

Rocky didn't like that  He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy"".  So one day he walked into town  Booked himself a room in the local saloon.    Rocky Raccoon checked into his room,  Only to find Gideon's Bible.  Rocky had come, equipped with a gun,  To shoot off the legs of his rival.  His rival it seems, had broken his dreams,  By stealing the girl of his fancy.  Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil,  But everyone knew her as Nancy.  Now she and her man, who called himself Dan,  Were in the next room at the hoe down.  Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin,  He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown"".  But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot,  And Rocky collapsed in the corner.    Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin,  And proceeded to lie on the table.  He said, ""Rocky, you met your match"".  And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch.  And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"".    Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room,  Only to find Gideon's Bible.  Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt,  To help with good Rocky's revival."

"Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs  Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.  And all the people that come and go  Stop and say ""Hello"".    On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,  And little children laugh at him behind his back.  And the banker never wears a mac  In the pouring rain, very strange.    Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  There beneath the blue suburban skies  I sit, and meanwhile back  In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,  And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.  He likes to keep his fire engine clean,  It's a clean machine.    Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  A four of fish and finger pies  In summer. Meanwhile back  Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout  The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.  And though she feels as if she's in a play,  She is anyway.    In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,  We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,  And then the fireman rushes in  From the pouring rain - very strange.    Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  There beneath the blue suburban skies  I sit, and meanwhile back.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.  There beneath the blue suburban skies  Penny Lane!"
Picture yourself in a boat on a river With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly A girl with kaleidoscope eyes  Cellophane flowers of yellow and green Towering over your head Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes And she's gone  Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ah  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers That grow so incredibly high  Newspaper taxis appear on the shore Waiting to take you away Climb in the back with your head in the clouds And you're gone  Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ah  Picture yourself on a train in a station With plasticine porters with looking glass ties Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes  Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ah Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Ah Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds

She was a working girl  North of England way  Now she's hit the big time  In the U.S.A.  And if she could only hear me  This is what I'd say.

Honey pie, you are making me crazy  I'm in love but I'm lazy  So won't you please come home.

"Turn off your mind relax and float down stream  It is not dying, it is not dying    Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,  It is shining, it is shining.    Yet you may see the meaning of within  It is being, it is being    Love is all and love is everyone  It is knowing, it is knowing    And ignorance and hate mourn the dead  It is believing, it is believing    But listen to the colour of your dreams  It is not leaving, it is not leaving    So play the game ""Existence"" to the end  Of the beginning, of the beginning"

Fella's sigh, and even cry   For sweet Georgia Brown.   I tell you just why   You know I don't lie.     It's been said   She knocks them dead   In any old town.   Since she came right   It's a shame   How she brings them down.   In Liverpool she even dare   To critize the Beatles' hair.   With their whole fanclub   Standing there   I mean sweet Georgia Brown.     I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you   Think so. Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!     When it comes to music   Sweet Georgia is known to mind,   Don't buy clothes at fashion shows   But she still looks fine   Snap chicks cry,   They want to die   When Georgie does the twist   I never would try   To tell you just why.   Use your imagination   There's a DJ crazy for her   Living in out home town   Since she came it's a shame   She turns him down   Records that she can get   Are records, they ain't sent him yet   Carolina may have Dina,   But that don't have Georgia Brown.     Oh that sweet Georgia,   Yeah yeah yeah I mean Brown, oh oh oh.   Sweet Georgia Brown.
